**Unit 5: Nervous System** <span id="5"></span> 
**The nervous system regulates both unconscious reflexes and intentional
movements.  We will begin this unit by studying nerve cells and their
supporting matrix.  Then, we will look at the gross anatomy of the
central and peripheral nervous systems.  Specifically, you will learn
the lobes of the brain, the 12 cranial nerves that connect the brain to
the spinal cord, and the functional regions of the spinal cord.  We will
also study the autonomic nerve network, which regulates visceral
function (i.e. breathing and digestion) as well at the somatic nerve
network, which regulates intentional movements and reflexes.**

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 18 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 5.1: 5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 5.2: 10 hours

☐    Subunit 5.2.1: 2 hours

☐    Subunit 5.2.2: 2 hours

☐    Subunit 5.2.3: 3 hours

☐    Subunit 5.2.4: 3 hours

☐    Subunit 5.3: 3 hours

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:  
-   Define the structures and functions of nervous tissue.
-   Describe the structures and functions of nervous system divisions.
-   Name the cranial nerves and their functions.
-   Describe the structure of the spinal cord and name the spinal cord
    tracts.
-   Name the major regions of the brain and describe the functions of
    each region.
