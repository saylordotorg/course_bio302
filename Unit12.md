**Unit 12: The Reproductive System** <span id="12"></span> 
**In this unit, we will learn the anatomical structures of the male and
female reproductive systems, which are entirely responsible for our
ability to produce offspring.**

**Unit 12 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 4.5 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 12.1: 0.5 hours
