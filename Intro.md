A thorough understanding of the systems of the body and the ways in
which they fit together is imperative for study in many fields of
biological inquiry, including medicine, physiology, developmental
studies, and biological anthropology. This course will provide you with
an overview of the body from a systemic perspective. Each unit will
focus on one system, or network of organs that work together to perform
a particular function. At the end of this course, we will review the
body from an integrative perspective, creating a more realistic vision
of the ways in which the systems overlap. We will also discuss current
body imaging techniques and learn how to correctly interpret the images
in order to put our newly-gained anatomical knowledge to practical use.
This is a terminology-heavy course. We will identify tissues and organ
systems according to their functional and regional contexts, but
information concerning the processes by which the tissues and organ
systems actually function will be covered in [BIO304: Human
Physiology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio304/). Pre-requisites: You
should have completed
either [BIO101](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio101a/)A or Bio101B:
Introduction to Molecular and Cellular Biology. Co-requisite: [Human
Anatomy Lab](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio302-lab/).

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:  

-   identify gross and microscopic anatomy and explain interactions of
    the major organ systems in the human body;
-   perform and analyze experiments in human anatomy (virtual);
-   use language necessary to appropriately describe human anatomy;
-   explain and identify how structure and function complement each
    other; and
-   describe how anatomy relates to medical situations in healthy and
    diseased states.

√    Have access to a computer.

√    Have continuous broadband Internet access.

√    Have the ability/permission to install plug-ins or software (e.g.,

### Course Information

Welcome to BIO302: Human Anatomy. General information about this course
and its requirements can be found below.  
    
 **Course Designer:** [Professor Ann
Schlosser](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-o-t/#ProfessorAnnSchlosser)  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course comprises a range of different free,
online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following:  

-   University of California-Berkeley: Professor Marian Diamond’s
    [General Human
    Anatomy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9WtBRNydso&list=SP9A701D54E8896D0E)
-   McGraw-Hill’s [Online Learning
    Center](http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072351136/student_view0/)
-   Bartleby.com’s version of Gray’s [Anatomy of the Human
    Body](http://www.bartleby.com/107/)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned material.
All units build on previous units, so it will be important to progress
through the course in the order presented.  
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the assessments in this course.   
  
 In order to *pass* this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.   
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of
approximately 116 hours to complete. Each unit includes a time advisory
that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit
and assignment. These time advisories should help you plan your time
accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at the time advisories
before beginning this course in order to determine how much time you
have over the next few weeks to complete each unit. Then, you can set
goals for yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you approximately 9
hours to complete. Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and
decide to complete Subunit 1.1 (a total of 3.5 hours) on Monday night,
Subunit 1.2 (a total of 3.5 hours) on Tuesday night, etc.
