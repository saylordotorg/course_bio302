**Unit 11: The Endocrine System** <span id="11"></span> 
**The endocrine glands regulate your physical development.  In this
unit, you will learn about the endocrine system—including the gonads,
which not only regulate the development of secondary sexual
characteristics but facilitate reproduction.  This unit will introduce
you to the names, functions, and structures of the major endocrine
organs.**

**Unit 11 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 9 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 11.1: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 11.2-11.9: 5 hours

**Unit11 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Describe the functions of the endocrine system and identify the
    glands.
-   Describe the structure and function of the pituitary, pineal,
    thymus, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, pancreas glands, and gonads.
