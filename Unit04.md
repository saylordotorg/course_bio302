**Unit 4: Muscular System** <span id="4"></span> 
**Muscles hold the skeletal framework together, enable us to move, and
allow us to react to our environment.  In this unit, we will learn about
muscular tissues at the microscopic level before reviewing muscle naming
conventions and learning the names of all of the major muscles in the
body (by region and by function).  Upon completion of this unit, you
should be able to identify which muscles work together in groups and how
an injury to one muscle can affect the function of others.**

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 22.5 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.1: 4.5 hours

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Describe criteria applied to name muscles.
-   Name and identify the muscles located in the head, neck, upper and
    lower limbs, abdomen, and thorax.
-   Describe the structure and functions of muscle tissue.
