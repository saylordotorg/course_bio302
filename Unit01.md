**Unit 1: Introduction to Anatomy** <span id="1"></span> 
**This unit will provide you with a quick overview of the body in order
to contextualize the subsequent units.  We will begin by covering
directional terminology and surface anatomy and conclude by identifying
each organ system and its respective functions.  Upon completion of this
unit, you should have a clear understanding of human anatomy at its
broadest level.*  
    
 *Note: To understand these concepts you should have knowledge of the
structure and function of a cell, which was covered in BIO101:
 Introduction to Cellular and Molecular Biology course. Please review
Unit 3: Cells of the BIO101 course as a refresher.**

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 9 hours to complete.
