**Unit 8: Respiratory System** <span id="8"></span> 
**When you breathe, the organs and tissues of your respiratory system
are working together in one cooperative action known as the breathing
mechanism.  Breathing enables you to capturing oxygen from the air that
can then distributed throughout the body via the blood so that cellular
respiration can take place.  In this unit, we will study the functional
structures that constitute the respiratory system, including the nose,
pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, lungs, and pleurae.**

**Unit 8 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 9 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 8.1: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 8.2: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 8.3: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 8.4: 1.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 8.5: 1.5 hours

**Unit8 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Describe the functions of the respiratory system and identify the
    organs.
-   Describe the anatomical structure of the nose, pharynx, larynx,
    trachea, bronchi, lungs, and pleurae in detail.
