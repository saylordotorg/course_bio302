**Unit 2: Integumentary System** <span id="2"></span> 
**The integumentary system (which is primarily comprised of the skin)
covers the organ systems of the body, providing structure, insulation,
and a first line of defense against infection.  In this unit, we will
study the integumentary system by taking a close look at the structure
of skin, hair, nails, and cutaneous glands.  Upon completion of this
unit, you should understand why the skin lays on the body as it does and
be able to explain the functional importance of the integumentary
system.**

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 4.5 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 2.1: 1.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.2: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.3: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.4: 1 hour

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Describe the structure and function of the skin.
-   Identify the cutaneous glands and describe their functions.
-   Describe the structure and function of hair and nail.
