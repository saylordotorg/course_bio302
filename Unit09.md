**Unit 9: Digestive System** <span id="9"></span> 
**Digestion allows you to extract useful nutrients from your food.  The
digestive process begins as soon as you put food into your mouth, when
your teeth and saliva begin to break down food items into more
manageable sizes, and continues into the stomach and intestines.  In
this unit we will familiarize ourselves with the names and functions of
each organ in the digestive system.  We will also learn about the
structures of the unique tissues and glands that enable us to absorb
nutrients from food.**
