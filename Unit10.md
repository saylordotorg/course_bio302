**Unit 10: Urinary System** <span id="10"></span> 
**The urinary system allows us to excrete potentially toxic wastes from
our bodies without losing the water-salt balance that our physiological
processes require.  We will begin by studying the structure of the
primary organ of the urinary system: the kidney.  You will learn that
the kidney is solely responsible for the complex process of filtration.
 We will then familiarize ourselves with the body’s urine storage and
transportation centers (the bladder, ureters, and urethra).**

**Unit 10 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 4.5 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 10.1: 1.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 10.2: 1 hour

**Unit10 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Describe the functions of the urinary system and identify the
    organs.
-   Describe the anatomical structure of the kidneys with an emphasis on
    nephrons.
-   Describe the anatomical structure of the ureters, bladder, and
    urethra (female and male).
