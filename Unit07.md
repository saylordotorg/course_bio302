**Unit 7: Lymphatic System** <span id="7"></span> 
**The lymphatic system is a major factor the body’s immune response.
 The lymphatic system allows immune cells, or lymphocytes, to travel all
over the body in lymphatic fluid—from the lymph nodes, through the
blood, and beyond the capillaries directly to the site of infection.
 Lymphatic vessels serve as an accessory to the blood vessels in this
circulatory process.  In this unit, we will look closely at the
properties of lymphatic fluid and the immune cells it transports before
learning the names and functions of the lymphatic organs and studying
how lymph travels through the body.**

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 4.5 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 7.1: 2.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 7.2: 2 hours

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Describe the functions of the lymphatic system and its interaction
    with other organ systems.
-   Describe the structure and functions of the lymphatic organs
    (lymphoid cells and tissues, lymph nodes, spleen, and other organs).
