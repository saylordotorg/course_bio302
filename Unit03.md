**Unit 3: Skeletal System** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, we will study the different types of bone tissues and
cells that comprise the skeletal framework.  We will learn bone naming
conventions as we discuss various sections of the skeleton and identify
the bones in each.  Finally, we will review the types of joints that
attach bones to one another, learning how they function.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 22.5 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 3.1: 4.5 hours

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Name, describe, and identify the skull bones.
-   Describe the structure of the vertebral column and the thoracic
    cage.
