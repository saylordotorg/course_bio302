**Unit 6: Cardiovascular System** <span id="6"></span> 
**The cardiovascular system consists of the heart, blood, and blood
vessels.  The heart and blood work together to circulate oxygen and
nutrition to all parts of the body.  In this unit, we will study the
properties of cardiac muscle, the chambers of the heart, and the various
layers that comprise a blood vessel.  We will also learn about the
body’s networks of blood vessels in order to gain an understanding of
the way in which blood circulates throughout the body.**

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 9 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 6.1: 4.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.2: 4.5 hours

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Explain the overall structure and function of the circulatory system
    including the organs.
-   Define the structure and function of the heart, including the heart
    tissue.
-   Explain the differences between the cardiac muscle and skeletal
    muscles.
-   Describe the structures and functions of the blood vessels with an
    emphasis on the walls.
